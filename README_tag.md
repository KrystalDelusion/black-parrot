Description: This is a demo of the Microsoft Zipline accelerator into the BlackParrot repo. The
integration was successful, but the codebase is large and unwieldy. Therefore, it belongs in a
separate repo along with the collection of necessary software enhancements. We leave this branch
here so that someone can someday take the necessary steps for full integration.
